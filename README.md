# ResonatorVR
Source scripts only for a VR shooter game for the HTC Vive made in Unity in 2016 as my final year project at college.

Resontator is a Virtual Reality shooter where you are a DJ who uses weaponised sound from your deck and a sound gun to shoot aliens attacking you in a club.

Using gestures with your left hand you change your ammo to be able to shoot different types of enemies with your right hand and build up your score. Enemies come in waves that increase in difficulty as you progress.

This is a game made as the second year final project at AIE for the second half of 2016. We had 4 Artists, 1 Designer, myself as programmer and an outsourced Audio Engineer.

Artists: Carly Hayward, Jennyfer Ong, Mel Lazcano and Tom Norfolk

Designer: Liam Turner

Audio Engineer: Wallace Potae

The designer also did programming, as this is my personal repository I only have scripts that I either created alone or worked on in partnership with Liam.
