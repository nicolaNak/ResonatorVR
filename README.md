# ResonatorVR
Source scripts only for a VR shooter game for the HTC Vive made in Unity.

Resontator is a Virtual Reality shooter where you are a DJ who uses weaponised sound from your deck and a sound gun to shoot aliens attacking you in a club.

This is a game made as the second year final project at AIE for the second half of 2016. We had 4 Artists, 1 Designer, myself as programmer and an outsourced Audio Engineer.
Artists: Carly Hayward, Jennyfer Ong, Mel Lacanzo and Tom Norfolk
Designer: Liam Turner
Audio Engineer: Wallace Potae

The designer also did programming, as this is my personal repository I only have scripts that I either created alone or worked on in partnership with Liam.
